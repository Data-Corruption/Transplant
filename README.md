# Sprout

Built with **love** <!-- as much as i'm legally allowed to give -->
and unhealthy amounts of caffeine, Sprout is a source template for per-user Go
CLI applications that may also need a background worker, a local HTTPS
dashboard, and signed self-updates. It's a complete example application, not a
framework or a library dependency: copy it, cut the features you don't need,
rename the module, and the result is ordinary Go and shell that belongs to you.

**Documentation: [sproutcli.dev](https://sproutcli.dev/)**

The site is built from [`docs/content/`](docs/content/docs/) in this
repository, so the same pages are readable here as plain Markdown if the site
is ever unreachable:

- [Getting started](docs/content/docs/getting-started/_index.md): features,
  cutting, building, releasing, installing, operating
- [Architecture](docs/content/docs/architecture.md): how it be
- [Philosophy](docs/content/docs/philosophy.md): why it be

## Quick start

```sh
# Use "Use this template" on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOU/YOUR_APP.git
cd YOUR_APP
./scripts/test.sh
./scripts/cut --module github.com/YOU/YOUR_APP            # preview
./scripts/cut --finalize --module github.com/YOU/YOUR_APP # apply
./scripts/build.sh
```

Pass feature names to `cut` (for example `service.https update`) to remove
them. The [getting started guide](https://sproutcli.dev/docs/getting-started/)
covers the rest.

## Requirements

Linux or WSL on `amd64`/`arm64`, the Go version in `go.mod`, Bash, and `curl`.
Race-enabled tests also need GCC. Release binaries target Linux and Windows 11
on both architectures; macOS and BSD are not currently supported.
